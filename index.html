			<td>
				<strong>Language:</strong> The national language of Japan is Japanese. English is widely spoken, especially in the tourism industry.<br>

               <strong>Currency:</strong> The official currency is the Japanese Yen (JPY).<br>

			<strong>Credit Cards And ATMs:</strong> In big cities like Tokyo and Osaka, you can pay for pretty much everything with your card. However, you’ll need cash for entrance fees, local markets and if you’re planning to explore Japan’s more remote destinations. If you need to withdraw money, you’ll usually find a machine that accepts foreign bank cards at the nearest 7-Eleven or post office.<br>

			<strong>Plugs:</strong> The plugs in Japan are type A and B. The standard voltage is 100 V, and the standard frequency is 50 / 60 Hz. I recommend buying a universal adapter (make sure it has surge protection) and using a converter for hairdryers and hot tools.
				<br>

			<strong>Safety:</strong> Japan is one of the safest countries in the world and is perfect for solo female travelers. Some hotels even offer female-only accommodation, and most trains have female-only cars. That being said, you’ll still want to practice common sense.<br>
